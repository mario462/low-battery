# low-battery
Fully configurable script to make your laptop alert you when battery is below a treshold.

The script comes with reasonable default parameters, but if you can to set your own, just create a `.low-battery` file in your home.
There is a sample config file included with the project.

The program relies on the `pulseaudio` sound server, as well as on the `aplay` command-line player.
 
If you find it useful give me a star :)
